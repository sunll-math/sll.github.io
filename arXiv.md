- **Critical quasilinear equations on Riemannian manifolds**  
  [arXiv:2502.08495v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08495v1)  
  *Published: 2025-02-12T10:30:40-05:00*  
  *Abstract: In this paper, we investigate critical quasilinear elliptic partial differential equations on a complete Riemannian manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature. By exploiting a new and sharp nonlinear Kato inequality and establishing some Cheng-Yau type gradient estimates for positive solutions, we classify positive solutions to the critical $p$-Laplace equation and show rigidity concerning the ambient manifold. Our results extend and improve some previous conclusions in the literature. Similar results are obtained for solutions to the quasilinear Liouville equation involving the $n$-Laplace operator, where $n$ corresponds to the dimension of the ambient manifold.*

- **Sinh-Gordon equations on finite graphs**  
  [arXiv:2406.17166v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17166v2)  
  *Published: 2024-06-24T18:41:50-04:00*  
  *Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the sinh-Gordon equation on graphs. We introduce a uniform a priori estimate to define the topological degree for this equation with nonzero prescribed functions on finite, connected and symmetric graphs. Furthermore, we calculate this topological degree case by case and show several existence results. In particular, we prove that the classical sinh-Gordon equation with nonzero prescribed function is always solvable on such graphs.*

- **Boundary value problem for the mean field equation on a compact Riemann surface**  
  [arXiv:2201.01544v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01544v1)  
  *Published: 2022-01-05T06:10:37-05:00*  
  *Abstract: Let $(\Sigma,g)$ be a compact Riemann surface with smooth boundary $\partial\Sigma$, $\Delta_g$ be the Laplace-Beltrami operator, and $h$ be a positive smooth function. Using a min-max scheme introduced by Djadli-Malchiodi (2006) and Djadli (2008), we prove that if $\Sigma$ is non-contractible, then for any $\rho\in(8k\pi,8(k+1)\pi)$ with $k\in\mathbb{N}^\ast$, the mean field equation $$\left\{\begin{array}{lll} \Delta_g u=\rho\frac{he^u}{\int_\Sigma he^udv_g}&{\rm in}&\Sigma\\[1.5ex] u=0&{\rm on}&\partial\Sigma \end{array}\right.$$ has a solution. This generalizes earlier existence results of Ding-Jost-Li-Wang (1999) and Chen-Lin (2003) in the Euclidean domain.
  Also we consider the corresponding Neumann boundary value problem. If $h$ is a positive smooth function, then for any $\rho\in(4k\pi,4(k+1)\pi)$ with $k\in\mathbb{N}^\ast$, the mean field equation $$\left\{\begin{array}{lll} \Delta_g u=\rho\left(\frac{he^u}{\int_\Sigma he^udv_g}-\frac{1}{|\Sigma|}\right)&{\rm in}&\Sigma\\[1.5ex] \partial u/\partial{\mathbf{v}}=0&{\rm on}&\partial\Sigma \end{array}\right.$$ has a solution, where $\mathbf{v}$ denotes the unit normal outward vector on $\partial\Sigma$. Note that in this case we do not require the surface to be non-contractible.*

- **Mean curvature flow of surfaces in a hyperk\"ahler $4$-manifold**  
  [arXiv:1902.00645v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00645v2)  
  *Published: 2019-02-02T00:56:46-05:00*  
  *Abstract: In this paper, we firstly prove that every hyper-Lagrangian submanifold $L^{2n} (n > 1)$ in a hyperk\"ahler $4n$-manifold is a complex Lagrangian submanifold. Secondly, we demonstrate an optimal rigidity theorem with the condition on the complex phase map of self-shrinking surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^4$. Last but not least, by using the previous rigidity result, we show that the mean curvature flow from a closed surface with the image of the complex phase map contained in $\mathbb{S}^2\setminus\overline{\mathbb{S}}^{1}_{+}$ in a hyperk\"ahler $4$-manifold does not develop any Type \Rmn{1} singularity.*

- **Rigidity theorems for minimal Lagrangian surfaces with Legendrian capillary boundary**  
  [arXiv:2007.03279v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03279v1)  
  *Published: 2020-07-07T04:34:52-04:00*  
  *Abstract: In this note, we study minimal Lagrangian surfaces in $\mathbb{B}^4$ with Legendrian capillary boundary on $\mathbb{S}^3$. On the one hand, we prove that any minimal Lagrangian surface in $\mathbb{B}^4$ with Legendrian free boundary on $\mathbb{S}^3$ must be an equatorial plane disk. One the other hand, we show that any annulus type minimal Lagrangian surface in $\mathbb{B}^4$ with Legendrian capillary boundary on $\mathbb{S}^3$ must be congruent to one of the Lagrangian catenoids. These results confirm the conjecture proposed by Li, Wang and Weng (Sci. China Math., 2020).*

- **Rigidity theorems of spacelike entire self-shrinking graphs in the pseudo-Euclidean space**  
  [arXiv:1910.08059v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08059v2)  
  *Published: 2019-10-17T13:45:16-04:00*  
  *Abstract: In this paper, we firstly establish a new volume growth estimate for spacelike entire graphs in the pseudo-Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{m+n}_n$. Then by using this volume growth estimate and the Co-Area formula, we prove various rigidity results for spacelike entire self-shrinking graphs.*

- **Complete Willmore Legendrian surfaces in $\mathbb{S}^5$ are minimal Legendrian surfaces**  
  [arXiv:1909.05119v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05119v2)  
  *Published: 2019-09-10T11:59:49-04:00*  
  *Abstract: In this paper we continue to consider Willmore Legendrian surfaces and csL Willmroe surfaces in $\mathbb{S}^5$, notions introduced by Luo in \cite{Luo}. We will prove that every complete Willmore Legendrian surface in $\mathbb{S}^5$ is minimal and construct nontrivial examples of csL Willmore surfaces in $\mathbb{S}^5$.*

- **A new characterization of the Calabi torus in the unit sphere**  
  [arXiv:1911.08155v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08155v1)  
  *Published: 2019-11-19T03:25:06-05:00*  
  *Abstract: In this paper, we study the rigidity theorem of closed minimally immersed Legendrian submanifolds in the unit sphere. Utilizing the maximum principle, we obtain a new characterization of the Calabi torus in the unit sphere which is the minimal Calabi product Legendrian immersion of a point and the totally geodesic Legendrian sphere. We also establish an optimal Simons' type integral inequality in terms of the second fundamental form of three dimensional closed minimal Legendrian submanifolds in the unit sphere.*

  [arXiv:1810.09445v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09445v1)  
  *Published: 2018-10-21T21:35:48-04:00*

- **Extrinsic eigenvalue estimates for Dirac operator**  
  [arXiv:1810.07342v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07342v1)  
  *Published: 2018-10-16T21:21:16-04:00*

- **On the volume of locally conformally flat 4 dimensional hypersphere**  
  [arXiv:1611.00516v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00516v2)  
  *Published: 2016-11-02T05:25:08-04:00*  
  *Abstract: Let $M$ be a 5 dimensional Riemannian manifold with $Sec_M\in[0,1]$, $\Sigma$ be a locally conformally flat hypersphere in $M$ with mean curvature $H$. We prove that, there exists $\varepsilon_0>0$, such that $\int_\Sigma (1+H^2)^2 \ge 8\pi^2/3$, provided $H \le \varepsilon_0$. In particular, if $\Sigma$ is a locally conformally flat minimal hypersphere in $M$, then $Vol(\Sigma) \ge 8\pi^2/3$, which partially answer a question proposed by Mazet and Rosenberg \cite{Ma&Rosen}. For an $(n+1)-$ dimensional rotationally symmetric Riemannian manifold $M$, we show that an immersed hypersurface $\Sigma$ is locally conformally flat if and only if ($n-1$) of the principal curvatures of $\Sigma$ are the same, which is a generalization of Cartan's result \cite{Cartan}. As an application, we prove that if $M$ is (some special but large class) rotationally symmetric 5-manifold with $Sec_M\in [0,1]$, and $\Sigma$ is a locally conformally flat hypersphere with mean curvature $H$, the inequality $\int_\Sigma (1+H^2)^2 \ge 8\pi^2/3$ holds for all $H$.*

- **A note on the nonexistence of quasi-harmonic spheres**  
  [arXiv:1604.02696v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02696v2)  
  *Published: 2016-04-10T10:37:00-04:00*  
  *Abstract: In this paper we study the properties of quasi-harmonic spheres from $\R^m, m>2$. We show that if the universal covering $\tilde N$ of $N$ admits a nonnegative strictly convex function $\rho$ with the exponential growth condition $\rho(y)\leq C\exp\left(\frac14\tilde d(y)^{2/m}\right)$ where $\tilde d(y)$ is the distance function on $\tilde N$, then $N$ does not admit a quasi-harmonic sphere, which generalize Li-Zhu's result \cite{Li2010non}. We also show that if $u$ is a quasi-harmonic sphere, then the property that $u$ is of finite energy ($\int_{\R^m}e(u)e^{-\abs{x}^2/4}\dif x<\infty$) is equivalent to the property that $u$ satisfies the large energy condition ($\lim_{R\to\infty}R^{m}e^{-R^2/4}\int_{B_R(0)}e(u)e^{-\abs{x}^2/4}\diff x=0$).*
